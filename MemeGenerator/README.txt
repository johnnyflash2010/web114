I chose the Meme Generator becuase it looked like fun, 
I have used tools like this before to create my own memes and 
wanted something that would be easy and fun to use. 

This project taught me how to more efficiently use CSS with my webpage, 
and I enjoy playing arounnd with the different settings. I've been 
to www.w3schools.com many times to help with my code.
